# ddaio
- ddaio in an drop-in replacement for Python built-in asyncio
- Eventhough this reimplementation covers most functionality offered by actual AsyncIO but still doesn't cover all the functionality.
- Nevertheless this reimplementation due to its minimal code is a good way to understand how the AsyncIO works internally.
- This implementation is not robust enought hence should not be considered for any realtime app development.
